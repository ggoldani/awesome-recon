# awesome-recon

Lightweight, ethical, and practical security tooling â€” focused on **recon, OSINT, and analysis**.  
All usage must be **authorized** and **for learning or defensive purposes**.

## What is this?
A growing collection of small, well-documented tools (Python & Bash) for:
- Passive recon & OSINT (DNS, certificates, headers, WHOIS, IP intel)
- Blue-team helpers (log parsing, simple anomaly checks)
- Red-team *only* in authorized lab environments (safe wrappers and reporting)

## Why this repo?
- Demonstrate clean scripting practices (Python + Bash)
- Show testable, modular code with clear CLI UX
- Build a portfolio recruiters can browse quickly

## Ethics & Legal
Use these tools **only** on systems you own or where you have **explicit written authorization**.  
The authors are not responsible for misuse or damage.
